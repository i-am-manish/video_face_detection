# video_face_detection & Identification


It has a folder called "Simple Face bounding box" which is a simple python code to draw a box around the face thus detecting it.

Now, rest is face identification from input video.


 (pretrained model folder contains the haarcascade needed.)

2. In DATA, there r -face images, videos, precompute features.

videos has a video(inside a folder named a label-*barack*)

on running pre-computefeatures.py, we extract images from video and put those in face_images and we save the model as pickle file with features.

Run python face_identify.py
